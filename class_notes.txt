Day-1
*****
	- Angular is the "Framework"

	- Angular is the "JavaScript" Framework

	- Angular Released by "Google"

	- Current Version of Angular is "Angular13".

	- Angular used to build the "web applications" and "mobile applications"

	- we will build Angular Applications with the help of "TypeScript"

	- TypeScript is the Programming Language

	- TypeScript released by Microsoft.

	- TypeScript follows the OOPS
			
		Ex.
			Inheritance

			Polymorphism

			Encapsulation
		
			Abstraction

			---
			---
			---
	- Superset of JavaScript also called as TypeScript.

	- we will save TypeScript files to with ".ts" extension

	- Browsers can't understand TypeScript

	- So, as Angular Developer we must convert TypeScript to Equalent javascript.

	- Conversion of TypeScript to Equalent JavaScript called as Transpilation

	- "tsc" is the tool used to perform the Transpilation.
	
	- "tsc" stands for TypeScript Compiler.

	- Visual Studio Code is Suggestable IDE to build the TypeScript and Angular Applications.

	- VSCode IDE given by microsoft and open source IDE.

	- TypeScript installation is Command Based Installation

	- TypeScript Installation Dependening on "npm" tool

	- "npm" stands for Node Packaging Manager.

	- "npm" available in NodeJS.

Day-2

Software Installations

1) download and install NodeJS

	NodeJS containes following tools
	
		1) npm

		2) node

		3) npx
	
	npm stands for node packaging manager

	npm is the tool, present in NodeJS

	node is the tool, helps to execute the JavaScript

	npx stands for node pckaging runner
	
	npx creates the environment, to build the React Applications

website : https://nodejs.org/en/download/

file    : node-v16.14.0-x64.msi


2) install TypeScript

		TypeScript is the command based installation

		> npm install -g typescript
	
		where "-g" stands for global installation


3) download and install Visual Studio Code

	website : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win

	file    : VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.64.2.exe


Transpilation
*************
	- Conversion of TypeScript to Equalent JavaScript called as Transpilation

	- "tsc" is the tool, used to perform Transpilation


Ex.
		> tsc demo.ts
			
			o/p

		demo.js

		> node demo.js


Day-4
*****
Variables


OOPS
****
classes
+++++++
	collection of "Variables" and "functions" called as class

	"Encapsulation" of Variables and functions also called as "class"

	we can create the classes with the help of "class" keyword

	we can create object to the classes by using "new" keyword

	we will define the constructors by using "constructor" keyword

	by default constructors will execute at "booting" time

	typescript supports the following modifiers

	1) public

	2) private

	3) protected

	recomended modifier for functions is "public"

	recomended modifier for Variables is "private"

	we will refer the Current class members with "this" keyword


interfaces
**********

	- when ever we know the declarations, and we dont know implementations then we will choose interfaces

	- we will declare the interfaces by using "interface" keyword

	- implementations known by either "classes" or "json"
